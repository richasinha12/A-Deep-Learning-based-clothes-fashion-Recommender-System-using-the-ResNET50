Fashion Recommendation is Deep Learning Project based on Convolutional Neural Networks. Achieved with Transfer learning technique With ResNet50(pre-trained model on imagenet). Used ResNet50 model for feature extraction and building model. Predicted the top 5 images closer to given input image with help of Nearest Neighbors algorithm based on euclidian distance. Converted the project on Streamlit website using Flask.
